HtDig::Database
Version 0.52, April 20, 2000

DESCRIPTION

    This module provides a perl interface to the ht://Dig database.
    It has been tested with ht://Dig 3.1.4, and will probably work
    with version 3.1.5 as well.  Because of changes in the database
    format, it ***will not work*** with version 3.2 and later.

    In fact, this implementation is probably a dead end.  It tries
    to duplicate the functions of ht://Dig in perl, but a better
    solution would be an XS module which would link directly to
    the ht://Dig code.  Until someone gets around to creating such
    a module, I hope this code provides a useful stopgap solution.

EXAMPLES

    Sample scripts in the "eg" subdirectory show how the
    HtDig::Database module can be used.
